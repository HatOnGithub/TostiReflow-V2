<h1>TostiReflow V2</h1>
This is a continuation of the original [TostiReflow Project](https://github.com/HatOnGithub/TostiReflow), now with a custom-designed PCB integrated directly into the oven itself.
Version 2, in addition to the features of Version 1, now has independent top and bottom heater control, convection fan control, 24-bit temperature accuracy, and touchscreen control. This comes at the cost of oven independence, as the system will be embedded inside the oven.
